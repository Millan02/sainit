Login to aws account.

Enabled MFA on root account. 
--> Virtual MFA
--> u2f key / yubykey 
--> Hardware mfa

Root user : Unrestricted access on aws account. (Closing account, account transfer, Support plan change)

IAM : Identity and access management : used to perform day to day activities.


s3 : Simple storage service : AWS version of gdrive. 
ec2 : Elastic compute cloud :  We can launch and run servers : 


Least privilages mechanism : Provide the access to perform his job/duties.

avinash : s3 full access : IAM : Share his cred
anudeep : ec2 full access : IAM : 
 : TL : Admin access : 

IAM User creation : 

Step 1 : Choose User name 	: sai

Step 2 : Choose access type	: 

--> Management console : GUI : un, pwd & sign-in : Browser
--> programatic access : CLI : Accesskeyid & Secretaccesskey : sdk, cdk, api, 3rd party

Step 3 : Allocate permissions

--> Create a group, Add permissions at group level.. Add this user to group.
--> COpy settings from another IAM user.
--> Attach permissions on user.

Policy : Set of permissions on our aws account.

Step 4 : Add Tags

Step 5 : review and create


Birth settings : 
--> MFA
--> Setup strong password policy for IAM users


Policy : 
--> AWS Managed policy : We cannot delete
--> AWS Managed - Job function : we cannot delete
--> Customer Managed policy : 

** DENY always have highest priority. 
If you allow 100 time, but denied 1 time = DENY


Req: Provide access on S3 and ec2 services.

Requirement : IAM user with Administrator access.. but not on s3.. 


Implicit allow : What are all the services access we provide, he can access only those services. Remaining all services will deny automatically.

Explicit Deny : What are the service set as deny, that will be denied.. If you allow at any level (user, group, resurce), Deny will take effect.

Policy simulator : It can simulate IAM users permissions.

Cloudtrail : Logging service in AWS. It stores last 90 days activities. 

Credentials Report : Report on When user last logged in, When user created, password last used, password reset date.

arn : Amazon resource name : arn name gives uniqueness to our aws resources.


Task 1 : Create an IAM user with S3 fullAccess and login as IAM user and verify his access on S3, ec2 and iam. 	Exp: He should able to see only s3 w/o error.

___
Task 2 : Create an IAM user, with "AdministratorAccess". (use the same user throughut course).

Task 3 : Login as task2 user.. And try to access "billing Information", It will show error/access denied.
Provide "billingaccess" to IAM user.
___

Task 4 : Create a new IAM User with S3 FullAccess.. 
Create a Policy to activate MFA himself.

___________________________________________________________________________________
Permissions Boundary : We can setup maximum permissions for an IAM user. 


Inline Policy : Policy for one single resource only. We cannot reuse this policy.


_______________________________________________________________________________________

S3: Simple Storage Sevice : 

--> Object based storage : We can store flat files / any files.
--> We store data in "Buckets"
--> Bucket nothing but a folder with unique name.
--> We can upload objects into bucket.
--> We can create 100 buckets in s3 platform by defaultly. (TO increase count raise service limit increase ticket)
--> Bucket naming Limitation :
	--> Should not start with . / Should not end with . / no adjesent ..
	--> Only Small characters / No Capital letters
	--> bucket name should not resemble IP address format.

--> S3 have unlimited data.
--> S3 supports max Object size : 5 TB, Min Obj size: 0/1 byte

Publicly accessable S3 Object URL : 
https://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname

Virtual Path: Works when we don't have . in the bucket name

https://bucketname.s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname


To make any object public, We need to Modify the bucket level settings, then object level settings.

Block all public access : --> OFF
Go to object promperty --> Make Public.

Availa: 99.99% , Durability : 99.999999999% (11 9's)

Interlligent Tier : When we have unknown access patterns for our data.. No idea on how freq we access data.. 
Data Spread across >= 3 AZs..
Availa: 99.9% , Durability : 99.999999999% (11 9's)

RRS : Redused Redunancy storage : Not used : Chances to loss the data is more.. it cost more than S3 standard.. Easily reprodusable data we can store here.. Logs/thumbnails.. 
Durability is Justn 99.99% only..
